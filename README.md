Goal: Control leds from arduino with telegram and explain the strugles.


## Steps
Step 1: Google control arduino leds with telegram.

I found a video how a youtuber send text with telegram and the arduino led changes color. I dont have a color led on my arduino so i gone start with turning my led on and off. I know that i need to use telegram so I gone download this app on my pc and computer.

Step 3 open example code 

I think that the echoBot the most simple option is to test and with that data I can expand the code.
